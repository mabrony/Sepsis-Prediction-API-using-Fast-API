# Sepsis-Prediction-API-using-Fast-API
Develop a Machine Learning API (Application Programming Interface) using FastAPI.
Building ML API to predict outcomes for SEPSIS Patients

Sepsis is a is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body’s response to an infection injures its own tissues and organs. It is a complex syndrome that is difficult to identify early, as its symptoms, such as fever and low blood pressure, overlap with those of other common illnesses. Without timely treatment, it can progress to septic shock, which has a hospital mortality rate greater than 40%.

Understanding which sepsis patients are at the highest risk for death could be useful for clinicians in prioritizing care. This model could provide guidance to medical teams on careful monitoring and preventive measures possible for those patients that have a high probability prediction of death.

This product is a collaborative environment with the tools needed to ingest, visualize, and build models with heterogeneous data sources. It provides data scientists with choices among the most popular languages (Python) and gives the choice of Jupyter notebooks or JupyterLab.

General
In the realm of healthcare, understanding the complex dynamics behind the occurrence of life-threatening conditions is of paramount importance. Sepsis, a potentially fatal condition resulting from the body’s extreme response to an infection, remains a major challenge for healthcare providers worldwide. Unraveling the secrets of sepsis occurrence can lead to improved early detection, timely interventions, and ultimately, better patient outcomes.

This project aims to delve into the vast pool of patient data, harnessing the power of data analysis and machine learning, to explore patterns and predictors associated with sepsis occurrence. By leveraging advanced computational techniques and drawing insights from comprehensive patient records, this research endeavor seeks to uncover hidden correlations, risk factors, and potential early warning signs that can facilitate earlier diagnosis and intervention.

Hypothesis
**Null Hypotheisi (H0)**  - There is no significant correlation between blood pressure and sepsis  
 **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)** - There is a significant correlation between blood pressure and sepsis
 
Predictive Model
After cleaning the data and applying feature selection, we defined our objective as a binary classification problem: predicting death during hospitalization through 90 days after discharge among sepsis patients.

For the algorithm to be used, we selected gradient boosted trees using the XGBoost package, which has been dominating popular machine learning competitions given its execution speed and robust performance. Another motivation for using XGBoost is the ability to fine tune hyper-parameters in order to improve the performance of the model. Within the training data, we used 10-fold cross validation and GridSearchCV to select parameter values in an iterative manner to maximize the area under the ROC curve (AUC).

We looked at a variety of metrics to measure success for our model, which is maximizing the prediction of mortality among sepsis patients.


We also used XGBoost’s capability to determine features importance using the “cover” parameter. This capability does not inform whether that feature is a strong predictor of death or strong predictor of survival, but the information generated by XGBoost is still very useful, as we can see the expected percentage of patients for which that feature is used in predicting death.

We conducted further exploratory analysis to examine how features are distributed with respect to the outcome variable (death). While these plots are helpful to visualize a high-level relationship with the outcome, it’s important to understand that XGBoost trains multiple decision trees, which are non-linear in nature. Due to this, important features in an XGBoost model may not have an obvious relationship with the outcome variable in these exploratory plots.

The decision tree rules outputted by XGBoost can be used to help further understand how to target patients for treatment. For example, the medical team may provide special attention to older patients due to their higher mortality risks, may monitor the duration of vasopressors taken, and may try to reduce the number of patient transfers between hospital departments in order to minimize the impact on susceptible patients, and so on.

Make sure you have FastAPI and any necessary dependencies installed. You can install FastAPI using pip:
pip install fastapi
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your main.py file is located.
Run the FastAPI application using the uvicorn command, specifying the module and application name:
uvicorn main:app --reload
After running the command, you should see output indicating that the FastAPI application is running and listening on a specific address (e.g., http:localhost:8000). This address represents the API endpoint where you can access your application.
Open a web browser or use an API testing tool (e.g., Postman) to interact with your deployed FastAPI application. Use the API endpoint provided in the terminal to make requests and receive responses.
API Documentation
The API documentation provides details about the available endpoints, request and response formats, and example usage. You can access the documentation by visiting the /docs endpoint after starting the server (http://localhost:8000/docs).
